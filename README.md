# Treadwell Programming Exercise Solution

## Setup

This project was written in Scala with OpenJDK 11. To build, test, and run the
code, use [`sbt`](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html).

## Running

Navigate to this project's base directory in a CLI and enter `sbt` to both
bootstrap the dependencies and enter the build tool's shell.

Once the shell has opened, execute `test` to run the project's unit tests.

To run the register program, execute `run`.

## Note

I'm still relatively new to the Scala programming language, so I might be guilty
of some unidiomatic practices.
